# GoldBadgeChallenges

Challenge One: Cafe

Bugs: Cannot Delete content correctly, but UI works.
      Not completely sure if all Unit Test needs are met.
      
      Potential Issues: Names are a little complicated.  It is difficult for me to remember their references 
      if I spend time away from the code.
      

Challenge Two: Claims
  Originally used string for ClaimType
  Enums were mentioned in class, so I used an enum for ClaimType.
  
Bugs:  Lots of issues with the UI.  Does not feel complete.  I had to rebuild this multiple times, and unfortunately was unable to build it to completion.


Challenge Three: Badges
  Did not use a list.  I used a string for BadgeContent at first.  Switched it after string = BadgeContent became overcomplicated.

Bugs: Did not get the Unit Tests working correctly either, and ran out of time.  Will most likely have to review Unit Tests in the near future.
      UI and the rest of the files should work however.  Did not get an update method in the Repository.
      

Overall, a very humbling experience.  I learned a great deal, and even with heavy time management, I did not get everything accomplished, and had a lot of last minute
issues pop up.  I am hoping to review the material further in the future and will continue building and perfecting all of the challenges for Gold badge.
